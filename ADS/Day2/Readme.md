# Recursive Functions
  Recursive functions are a unique type of function that has the ability to call itself in order to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller and more manageable subproblems. The concept of recursion revolves around the principle of self-reference where the solution to the larger problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

# Key Features of Recursive Functions

  Base Case: The condition(s) under which the recursive function stops calling itself. This prevents the function from running indefinitely.
  Recursive Case: The part of the function where the function calls itself, working towards reaching the base case.
  Below is a Python code snippet showcasing the usage of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:

  
  def factorial(n):
      if n == 1:
          return 1
      else:
          return n * factorial(n-1)
  

# What's happening here? When n isn't 1, the function calls itself with 
 reduced by 1. This keeps happening until 
 is 1. At this point, the function stops calling itself and starts multiplying all these numbers together, resulting in the factorial of the initial input number.
